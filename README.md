A classical problem: a ferry man brings a wolf, a rabbit and a cabbage and the man is going to take them cross the river. 
However, the boat is too small to load all members. The man can bring only one member at a time.
Every one should know the wolf will eat the rabbit, the rabbit will eat the cabbage,if there is not the man nearby.
Conversely, when the man accompany the wolf, the rabbit and cabbage, each member will be safe.
So, output all solutions about how the ferry man transports all members from bank A to bank B.
